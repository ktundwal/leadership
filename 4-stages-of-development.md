# 4 stages of development

## Stage 1. Enthusiastic beginner

### \(low competence and high commitment\)

On most new goals or tasks, people do not have a lot of experience and have not been trained on that specific goal or task. As a result, their competence is low. At the same time, they are eager and feel motivated to do the goal or task. They often have strong transferable skills that help them feel confident they will succeed. Their commitment is high. Someone with low competence and high commitment on a specific goal or task is at development level 1, or D1 for short.

_You have not been trained on this specific goal. You are eager and feels motivated to accomplish it._

## Stage 2. Disillusioned learner

### some competence and low commitment

As people learn, competence increases, but commitment often decreases. The goal or task is harder than they thought it would be. They get frustrated or overwhelmed and can be confused about next steps. Someone who has low to some competence and low commitment is at development level 2 on the goal or task at hand. A person is not able to accomplish the goal or task independently.

_You are frustrated and overwhelmed. Your goal seems harder than you thought it would be._

## Stage 3. Capable, but cautious, contributor

### moderate to high competence and variable commitment

Next, people begin to master the goal or task and develop moderate to high competence. But it can be easy one day, then challenging the next. They might feel confident one moment, then second-guess themselves the next. AS a result, their commitment will be variable. Someone with moderate to high competence and variable commitment is at development level 3 on the goal or task at hand.

_You feel confident one moment, then second-guesses yourself the next. You are cautious about achieving your goal._

## Stage 4. Self-reliant achiever

### high competence and high commitment

With support, people develop into individuals who know what needs to be done and how to do it well. These individuals have learned to trust their skills and are confident and motivated on a specific goal or task. Someone with high competence and high commitment is at development level 4 at that goal or task.

_You now know what needs to be done and how to do it well. You trust your skills and are confident and motivated._

## Apply in practice

1. What is the goal?
2. How competent is the individual \(currently\) at the goal or task?
3. How committed \(motivated and confident\) is the individual to the goal or task?
